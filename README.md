##Features

The donation form was built using the Square API client PHP library. Project manager requested a password wall to protect the form, which was accomplished using a .htpasswd file and MD5 encryption. Many form fields were marked as required, to comply with Federal regulations for PAC donations. On submit, the user's credit card was charged and their personal information itemized and sent to Square, to be viewed in the Square dashboard. The CSS was meant to replicate the look and feel of www.agc.org and is responsive.
